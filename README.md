# Diabetes-Prediction
# AIM:
To Predict whether the person is Diabetic or not.
# Diabetes:
Diabetes is a health condition that affects how your body turns food into energy. Most of the food you eat is broken down into sugar (also called glucose) and released into your bloodstream. When your blood sugar goes up, it signals your pancreas to release insulin.
Without ongoing, careful management, diabetes can lead to a build up of sugars in the blood, which can increase the risk of dangerous complications, including stroke and heart disease
# DATASET:
In this project i used Pima Indians Diabetes Database from Kaggle. This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.
# MODEL USED:
I tried different models and compare the accuracy for each. Then, I performed Hyperparameter Tuning on Models that has high accuracy. I have used Support Vector Machine Model for the prediction of Diabetes.

In the Support Vector Machine Model, as we train the Machine Learning Model with the Data the Support Vector Machine Model after training the data it identifies a hyperplane and divide it into Positive and Negative hyperplane.
